<p>05_SEPTEMBER_2022: 19_AUGUST_2022: No later than 01_OCTOBER_2022 (if I do not have a paid job already), I plan on applying for part-time jobs at the local mall (and other places within a reasonable walking distance of BART) at stores such as Macy&#8217;s and JC Penny. Right now I am sitting in a nice ditch on the edge of a large field next to some sleek corporate buildings and apartments enjoying the refreshing breeze and light of the golden hour as it imbues the dry grass and green shrubs with a yellow hue (and the blue sky looks like a sapphire sharpened by the color contrast between earth and sky). There is a modest amount of THC in my system from digesting a hashtab earlier.</p>
<p>On the secondary website (i.e. this one (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com)), I re-added the link to the tertiary website (i.e. Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com) after I added two more pages to the highlighted chapter of the pink bin of that tertiary website. (The primary website is Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com).</p>
<p>I felt the need to close the previous chapter of this journal with a journal entry web page showcasing a screenshot of a Minds dot Com post I made showcasing the <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/hexidecimal_color_codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HEXIDECIMAL_COLOR_CODES</a> JavaScript application I recently updated. I think a natural transition from that application is <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/probability_copy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PROBABILITY</a> (which is intended to be a C++ command line application instead of another fancy-looking web application). Before I starting writing this journal entry web page, I was planning on writing another JavaScript application for counting the number of times specific sequences of characters appear in a particular string of text (and that application is <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/word_counter_copy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WORD_COUNTER</a>). I am not sure whether I will just delve into the nitty gritty of probability and do the C++ application first or else just do another &#8220;crowd pleaser&#8221; (which is what the word counting app looks like to me). Since I am my own target audience (and I am a system comprised of me, myself, and I), I decided I will try to please the crowd first and give them another shiny app with a colorful Graphical User Interface of a web page.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is something else weighing on my conscience as well&#8230;the need to expand on what I said in <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/multiverse_copy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a> (which I updated a few hours ago).</p>
<p>I think it might be a good idea to add an entire new page to the primary website about karma (across multiple lifetimes as one reincarnated being) and how karma accumulated from past lives and past events in the current life hypothetically effects what transpires in future life times and in future events within the current life. I think it would explain why there is social inequality, poverty, and seemingly preventable and recurring problems happening for people. Perhaps I can write some kind of quick and easy blueprint for how to navigate that karma and use it to speed up progress and to waste less time.</p>
<p>I may have to issue some kind of disclaimer explaining that I am just a philosopher and not some kind of doctor or powerful alien attempting to take over the world, but I think that may be a bit redundant. Either people think I am crazy or they think I have something worthwhile (and maybe even useful to them) to say.</p>
<p>What if every person had all the free time it wanted? What if every person could spend as much time as they wanted to reading and writing (and being part of a community of artists sharing their art and providing to each other inspiration and feedback)?</p>
<p>A favorite teacher of mine said something like this: <span style="background:#ffff00;">as an individual or a collective becomes more advanced, the problems that individual or collective faces become more complex. There will always be problems to solve no matter how advanced civilization gets.</span></p>
