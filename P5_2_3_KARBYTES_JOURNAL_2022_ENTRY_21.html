<p>17_AUGUST_2022: Confession: I have what seems to be a tolerable amount of species dysphoria. I find many things about the human condition to be repulsive or, at the very least, mildly irritating. I am also in deep mortal dread about the prospect of dying and/or losing functionalities such as major senses, locomotion, and cognitive functions. I have been endeavoring to minimize how much I dwell on such macabre topics so as not to create a ripple effect of unproductive dread.</p>
